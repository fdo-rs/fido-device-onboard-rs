## Pre-requisites

- You need to build this crate with the `--release` profile, see
[CONTRIBUTING.md:
Developing/building](https://github.com/fedora-iot/fido-device-onboard-rs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#developing--building).

  These how-tos assume that you have successfully built the different FIDO
  infrastructure binaries: `fdo-admin-tool`, `fdo-client-linuxapp`,
  `fdo-manufacturing-client`, `fdo-manufacturing-server`,
  `fdo-owner-onboarding-server`, `fdo-owner-tool`, `fdo-rendezvous-server` and
  `fdo-serviceinfo-api-server`.

- You need to have a general knowledge of the [FIDO Device Onboard
  Specification](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/FDO/FIDO-Device-Onboard-RD-v1.1-20211214/).

## How-Tos

### How to generate keys and certificates

Use `fdo-admin-tool generate-key-and-cert` to generate the required keys for
`diun`, `manufacturer`, `device-ca` or `owner`. 

```bash
USAGE:
    fdo-admin-tool generate-key-and-cert [OPTIONS] <SUBJECT>

ARGS:
    <SUBJECT>    Subject of the key and certificate [possible values: diun, manufacturer,
                 device-ca, owner]

OPTIONS:
        --country <COUNTRY>
            Country name for the certificate [default: US]

        --destination-dir <DESTINATION_DIR>
            Writes key and certificate to the given path [default: keys]

    -h, --help
            Print help information

        --organization <ORGANIZATION>
            Organization name for the certificate [default: Example]

    -V, --version
            Print version information
```

Note in the results that `.der` indicate private keys and `.pem` certificates.

### How to generate an Ownership Voucher (OV) and Credential for a Device (Device Initialization)

Use `fdo-owner-tool initialize-device`:

```
USAGE:
    fdo-owner-tool initialize-device <device-id> <ownershipvoucher-out> <device-credential-out> --device-cert-ca-chain <device-cert-ca-chain> --device-cert-ca-private-key <device-cert-ca-private-key> --manufacturer-cert <manufacturer-cert> --rendezvous-info <rendezvous-info>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --device-cert-ca-chain <device-cert-ca-chain>                Chain with CA certificates for device certificate
        --device-cert-ca-private-key <device-cert-ca-private-key>    Private key for the device certificate CA
        --manufacturer-cert <manufacturer-cert>                      Path to the certificate for the manufacturer
        --rendezvous-info <rendezvous-info>
            Path to a TOML file containing the rendezvous information


ARGS:
    <device-id>                Identifier of the device
    <ownershipvoucher-out>     Output path for ownership voucher
    <device-credential-out>    Output path for device credential
```

Where the arguments for `--device-cert-ca-chain`,
`--device-cert-ca-private-key` and `--manufacturer-cert` have been generated as
seen in [How To Generate Keys and
Certificates](#how-to-generate-keys-and-certificates) and the argument for
`--rendezvous-info` is a YAML file containing a list of contact information for the
different Rendezvous Servers (see [Configuration
Files/rendezvous_info.yml](#rendezvous_info-field-and-rendezvous_infoyml)).

```bash
  $ fdo-owner-tool initialize-device \
  1234 \
  /path/to/resulting/ownership_voucher \
  /path/to/resulting/device_credential \
  --device-cert-ca-chain ./keys/device_ca_cert.pem \
  --device-cert-ca-private-key ./keys/device_ca_key.der \
  --manufacturer-cert ./keys/manufacturer_cert.pem \
  --rendezvous-info /usr/share/fdo/rendezvous-info.yml

  Created ownership voucher for device 2466056e-b71d-4a09-fb57-8aa49f003686
  ```

The generated OV is in PEM (plain-text) format, but if you are using this OV in the
`owner-onboarding-server` you will need to convert it to COSE format, plus the
OV will need to be extended with the Owner's Certificate.

### How to get information about an OV

Use `fdo-owner-tool dump-ownership-voucher` to get all the available
information about an OV. The input OV can be in PEM or COSE format.

```
USAGE:
    fdo-owner-tool dump-ownership-voucher [OPTIONS] <path>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --outform <outform>    Output format [possible values: pem, cose]

ARGS:
    <path>    Path to the ownership voucher
```

```
$ fdo-owner-tool dump-ownership-voucher ov.cose

For an explanation of each field refer to [Ownership
Voucher](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/FDO/FIDO-Device-Onboard-RD-v1.1-20211214/#OwnershipVoucher). 

### How to extend an OV with the Owner's Certificate

Use `fdo-owner-tool extend-ownership-voucher`:

```
USAGE:
    fdo-owner-tool extend-ownership-voucher <path> --current-owner-private-key <current-owner-private-key> --new-owner-cert <new-owner-cert>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --current-owner-private-key <current-owner-private-key>    Path to the current owner private key
        --new-owner-cert <new-owner-cert>                          Path to the new owner certificate

ARGS:
    <path>    Path to the ownership voucher
```

```
$ fdo-owner-tool extend-ownership-voucher ov \
    --current-owner-private-key ./keys/manufacturer_key.der \
    --new-owner-cert ./keys/owner_cert.pem
```

You can check that the OV has been properly extended using `fdo-owner-tool
dump-ownership-voucher` and checking the `Entries` field, it should contain the
Owner's public key:

```

```

### How to convert a PEM (plain-text) format OV to a COSE (binary) format OV

Use `fdo-owner-tool dump-ownership-voucher`:

```bash
fdo-owner-tool dump-ownership-voucher your_ownership_voucher --outform cose > your_ownership_voucher.cose
```

## Configuration Files

This project uses
[YAML](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html)
syntax for its configuration files.

Example configuration files like the ones used in this section can be found in
the
[examples/config](https://github.com/fedora-iot/fido-device-onboard-rs/blob/main/examples/config/)
directory of this project.

- When a field is optional `[OPTIONAL]` will be listed next to it, otherwise
  treat it as required.
- When a field is required but its sub-fields are all optional you may put a
  null value (`~`) there.

### `manufacturing_server.yml`

The most up-to-date configuration settings will be on [util/src/servers/configuration/manufacturing_server.rs](https://github.com/fedora-iot/fido-device-onboard-rs/blob/main/util/src/servers/configuration/manufacturing_server.rs).

#### `rendezvous_info` field and `rendezvous_info.yml`

The `rendezvous_info` field was previously named `rendezvous_info_path`, which
instead of containing a list of contact methods to reach different Rendezvous
Servers it contained the path to a configuration file (`rendezvous_info.yml`)
that had this same info.

If you are using the `fdo-owner-tool` to initialize a device you will need to
pass a `rendezvous_info.yml` YAML file (not to be confused with the
`rendezvous_server.yml`) as one of the configuration parameters.

```yml
---
- ip_address: 192.168.122.1
  deviceport: 8082
  ownerport: 8082
  protocol: http
- dns: fdo.example.com
  device_port: 8082
  owner_port: 8082
  protocol: http
```

The fields of this `rendezvous_info.yml` file are the same ones that can be
found in the `rendezvous_info` field of the `manufacturing_server.yml`.

## How to run the servers

Please mind how the configuration file must be specifically named (e.g. `-` VS
`_`).

### Manufacturing Server

1. Generate the required keys/certificates for the Manufacturing Server, see
   [How to generate keys and certificates](#how-to-generate-keys-and-certificates).

   You will need the Manufacturers private key and certificate, the Owner's
   certificate and the Device's private key and certificate.

2. Configure `manufacturing-server.yml`, see [Configuration
   Files/manufacturing_server.yml](#manufacturing_serveryml) and place it either in
   `/usr/share/fdo`, `/etc/fdo/` or
   `/etc/fdo/manufacturing-serverr.conf.d/`. The paths will be checked in that
   same order.

3. Execute `fdo-manufacturing-server` or run it as a service, see sample
   file in
   [examples/systemd](https://github.com/fedora-iot/fido-device-onboard-rs/blob/main/examples/systemd/fdo-manufacturing-server.service).

### Owner Onboarding Server

1. Generate the required keys/certificates for the Owner, see [How to generate
   keys and certificates](#how-to-generate-keys-and-certificates).

2. Configure `owner-onboarding-server.yml`, see [Configuration
   Files/owner_onboarding_server.yml](#owner_onboarding_serveryml) and place it
   either in `/usr/share/fdo`, `/etc/fdo/` or
   `/etc/fdo/owner-onboarding-server.conf.d/`. The paths will be checked in
   that same order.

3. Generate an Ownership Voucher (see [How to generate an Ownership
   Voucher](#how-to-generate-an-ownership-voucher-ov-and-credential-for-a-device-device-initialization)),
   extend it with the Owner's Certificate (see [How to extend an OV with the
   Owner's Certificate](#how-to-extend-an-ov-with-the-owners-certificate)) and
   convert it to COSE format (see [How to convert a PEM (plain-text) format OV
   to a COSE (binary) format OV](#how-to-convert-a-pem-plain-text-format-ov-to-a-cose-binary-format-ov)).
   
   Rename the generated OV to its Device GUID (see [How to get information about an
   OV](#how-to-get-information-about-an-ov) to identify its Device GUID) and
   store it in the path given to the `ownership_voucher_store_driver` field in
   the `owner_onboarding_server.yml` of the previous step.

4. Execute `fdo-owner-onboarding-server` or run it as a service, see sample
   file in [examples/systemd](https://github.com/fedora-iot/fido-device-onboard-rs/blob/main/examples/systemd/fdo-owner-onboarding-server.service).

### Rendezvous Server

1. Configure `rendezvous-server.yml`, see [Configuration
   Files/rendezvous_server.yml](#rendezvous_serveryml) and place it either in
   `/usr/share/fdo`, `/etc/fdo/` or `/etc/fdo/rendezvous-server.conf.d/`. The
   paths will be checked in that same order.

2. Execute `fdo-rendezvous-server` or run it as a service, see sample file in
   [examples/systemd](https://github.com/fedora-iot/fido-device-onboard-rs/blob/main/examples/systemd/fdo-rendezvous-server.service).

### Service Info API Server

1. Configure `serviceinfo-api-server.yml`, see [Configuration
   Files/serviceinfo_api_server.yml](#serviceinfo_api_serveryml), and place it either in
   `/usr/share/fdo`, `/etc/fdo/` or `/etc/fdo/serviceinfo-api-server.conf.d/`. The
   paths will be checked in that same order.

2. Execute `fdo-serviceinfo-api-server` or run it as a service, see sample file
   in
   [examples/systemd](https://github.com/fedora-iot/fido-device-onboard-rs/blob/main/examples/systemd/fdo-serviceinfo-api-server.service).

## How to run the Client

1. Initialize the Device, see [How to generate an Ownership Voucher (OV) and
    Credential for a Device (Device
    Initialization)](#how-to-generate-an-ownership-voucher-ov-and-credential-for-a-device-device-initialization).

2. The client will look for the Device Credential created during the previous
  step. It will look for in on
  `/sys/firmware/qemu_fw_cfg/by_name/opt/device_onboarding/devicecredential/raw`
  or in the location specified by the `DEVICE_CREDENCIAL` environment variable,
  in that order.

    ```bash
    export DEVICE_CREDENTIAL=/path/to/device_credential
    ```

3. Run the client: `fdo-client-linuxappp`
