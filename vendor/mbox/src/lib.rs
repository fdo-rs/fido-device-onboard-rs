//! `mbox`: `malloc`-based box
//! ==========================
//!
//! This crate provides structures that wrap pointers returned from `malloc` as a Box, and
//! automatically `free` them on drop. These types allow you to interact with pointers and
//! null-terminated strings and arrays in a Rusty style.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate libc;
//! extern crate mbox;
//!
//! use libc::{c_char, malloc, strcpy};
//! use mbox::MString;
//!
//! // Assume we have a C function that returns a malloc'ed string.
//! unsafe extern "C" fn create_str() -> *mut c_char {
//!     let ptr = malloc(12) as *mut c_char;
//!     strcpy(ptr, b"Hello world\0".as_ptr() as *const c_char);
//!     ptr
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // we wrap the null-terminated string into an MString.
//!     let string = unsafe { MString::from_raw_unchecked(create_str()) };
//!
//!     // check the content is expected.
//!     assert_eq!(&*string, "Hello world");
//!
//!     // the string will be dropped by `free` after the code is done.
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! > Note: This crate does not support Windows in general.
//! >
//! > Pointers in Rust are required to be aligned to be sound. However, there is no API on
//! > Windows that are both compatible with `free()` and supports aligned-malloc.
//! >
//! > Because the primary purpose of this crate is interoperability with C code working
//! > with `malloc()`, it is impossible for us to switch to the safe variant like
//! > [`_aligned_malloc()`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/aligned-malloc)
//! > (which requires [`_aligned_free()`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/aligned-free)).
//! >
//! > On Windows, trying to use `MBox<T>` or `MArray<T>` with `T`'s alignment not equal to 1
//! > will not compile.
//! >
//! > ```rust,compile_fail
//! > # #[cfg(not(windows))] { _ };
//! >
//! > use mbox::MBox;
//! > let value = MBox::new(1_u64); // will not compile,
//! > ```
//!
//!
//! ## Installation
//!
//! Add this to your Cargo.toml:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! mbox = "0.7"
//! ```
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! This crate provides three main types, all of which uses the system's `malloc`/`free` as the
//! allocator.
//!
//! * `MBox<T>` â€” Similar to `Box<T>`.
//! * `MString` â€” Similar to `std::ffi::CString`.
//! * `MArray<T>` â€” A null-terminated array, which can be used to represent e.g. array of C strings
//!   terminated by a null pointer.
//!
//! ### `#![no_std]`
//!
//! You may compile `mbox` and disable the `std` feature to not link to `std` (it will still link to
//! `core`.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! mbox = { version = "0.7", default-features = false }
//! ```
//!
//! When `#![no_std]` is activated, you cannot convert an `MString` into a `std::ffi::CStr`, as the
//! type simply does not exist ðŸ™‚.
//!
//! ### Nightly
//!
//! To use nightly-channel features (if you need support for custom dynamic-sized types), enable the
//! `nightly` feature:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! mbox = { version = "0.7", features = ["nightly"] }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Migrating from other crates
//!
//! Note that `MBox` does not support custom allocator. If the type requires custom allocation,
//! `MBox` cannot serve you.
//!
//! * [`malloc_buf`](https://crates.io/crates/malloc_buf) â€” `Malloc<T>` is equivalent to `MBox<T>`.
//!   Note however that `MBox<[T]>::from_raw_parts` will not allow null, 0-length buffers; use a
//!   dangling pointer instead.
//!
//! * [`cbox`](https://crates.io/crates/cbox) â€” When not using a custom `DisposeRef`, the
//!   `CSemiBox<'static, T>` type is equivalent to `MBox<T>`, and `CBox<T>` is equivalent to
//!   `&'static T`.
//!
//! * [`c_vec`](https://crates.io/crates/c_vec) â€” When using `free` as the destructor, `CVec<T>` is
//!   equivalent to `MBox<[T]>` and `CSlice<T>` as `[T]`.
//!
//! * [`malloced`](https://crates.io/crates/malloced) â€” `Malloced<T>` is equivalent to `MBox<T>`.
//!   Note however that `mbox` depends on `libc` (more stable, but also longer build-time) and
//!   doesn't support `dyn Any` downcasting.
//!
//! * [`malloc-array`](https://crates.io/crates/malloc-array) â€” `HeapArray<T>` is similar to
//!   `MBox<T>`, but this crate focuses more on raw memory management.
