This UNIC component implements algorithms from [Unicode® Standard Annex #29 -
Unicode Text Segmentation](http://unicode.org/reports/tr29/), used for detecting
boundaries of text element boundaries, such as user-perceived characters (a.k.a.
*Grapheme Clusters)*, *Words*, and *Sentences*.

## Notes

Initial code for this component is based on
[`unicode-segmentation`](https://github.com/unicode-rs/unicode-segmentation).
