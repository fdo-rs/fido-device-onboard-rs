# deunicode

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/deunicode/)

The `deunicode` library transliterates Unicode strings such as "√Üneid" into pure
ASCII ones such as "AEneid." Includes support for emoji. It's compatible with no-std Rust environments.

This is a maintained alternative to the [unidecode](https://lib.rs/crates/unidecode) crate, which started as a Rust port of [`Text::Unidecode`](http://search.cpan.org/~sburke/Text-Unidecode-1.30/lib/Text/Unidecode.pm) Perl module.

Deunicode is quite fast, and uses a compact representation of Unicode data to minimize memory overhead and executable size (about 70K codepoints mapped to 240K ASCII characters, using 450KB or memory, 160KB gzipped).

Examples
--------
```rust
use deunicode::deunicode;

assert_eq!(deunicode("√Üneid"), "AEneid");
assert_eq!(deunicode("√©tude"), "etude");
assert_eq!(deunicode("Âåó‰∫∞"), "Bei Jing");
assert_eq!(deunicode("·îï·ìá·ìá"), "shanana");
assert_eq!(deunicode("„Åí„Çì„Åæ„ÅÑËå∂"), "genmaiCha");
assert_eq!(deunicode("ü¶Ñ‚ò£"), "unicorn biohazard");
```

Guarantees and Warnings
-----------------------
Here are some guarantees you have when calling `deunicode()`:
  * The `String` returned will be valid ASCII; the decimal representation of
    every `char` in the string will be between 0 and 127, inclusive.
  * Every ASCII character (0x00 - 0x7F) is mapped to itself.
  * All Unicode characters will translate to printable ASCII characters
    (`\n` or characters in the range 0x20 - 0x7E).

There are, however, some things you should keep in mind:
  * Some transliterations do produce `\n` characters.
  * Some Unicode characters transliterate to an empty string, either on purpose
    or because `deunicode` does not know about the character.
  * Some Unicode characters are unknown and transliterate to `"[?]"`
    (or a custom placeholder, or `None` if you use a chars iterator).
  * Many Unicode characters transliterate to multi-character strings. For
    example, "Âåó" is transliterated as "Bei".
  * The transliteration is context-free, and not sophisticated enough to produce proper Chinese or Japanese.
    Han characters used in multiple languages are mapped to a single Mandarin pronounciation,
    and will be mostly illegible to Japanese readers. Transliteration can't
    handle cases where a single character has multiple possible pronounciations.
