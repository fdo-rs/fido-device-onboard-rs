# libcryptsetup-rs-sys

This crate provides low-level Rust bindings generated by bindgen for libcryptsetup.

### Building

The libcryptsetup bindings require some dependencies outside of cargo to build
properly:
1. cryptsetup (provided by `cryptsetup` on Fedora)
2. cryptsetup development headers (provided by `cryptsetup-devel` on Fedora)
3. libclang (provided by `clang` on Fedora)

### Testing

Tests are automatically generated by bindgen. To check that bindings have been
generated correctly, run:
```
cargo test
```
