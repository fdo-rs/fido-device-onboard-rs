//! Helper types for prepared statement caching
//!
//! A primer on prepared statement caching in Diesel
//! ------------------------------------------------
//!
//! Diesel uses prepared statements for virtually all queries. This is most
//! visible in our lack of any sort of "quoting" API. Values must always be
//! transmitted as bind parameters, we do not support direct interpolation. The
//! only method in the public API that doesn't require the use of prepared
//! statements is [`SimpleConnection::batch_execute`](super::SimpleConnection::batch_execute).
//!
//! In order to avoid the cost of re-parsing and planning subsequent queries,
//! Diesel caches the prepared statement whenever possible. Queries will fall
//! into one of three buckets:
//!
//! - Unsafe to cache
//! - Cached by SQL
//! - Cached by type
//!
//! A query is considered unsafe to cache if it represents a potentially
//! unbounded number of queries. This is communicated to the connection through
//! [`QueryFragment::is_safe_to_cache_prepared`]. While this is done as a full AST
//! pass, after monomorphisation and inlining this will usually be optimized to
//! a constant. Only boxed queries will need to do actual work to answer this
//! question.
//!
//! The majority of AST nodes are safe to cache if their components are safe to
//! cache. There are at least 4 cases where a query is unsafe to cache:
//!
//! - queries containing `IN` with bind parameters
//!     - This requires 1 bind parameter per value, and is therefore unbounded
//!     - `IN` with subselects are cached (assuming the subselect is safe to
//!        cache)
//!     - `IN` statements for postgresql are cached as they use `= ANY($1)` instead
//!        which does not cause a unbound number of binds
//! - `INSERT` statements with a variable number of rows
//!     - The SQL varies based on the number of rows being inserted.
//! - `UPDATE` statements
//!     - Technically it's bounded on "number of optional values being passed to
//!       `SET` factorial" but that's still quite high, and not worth caching
//!       for the same reason as single row inserts
//! - `SqlLiteral` nodes
//!     - We have no way of knowing whether the SQL was generated dynamically or
//!       not, so we must assume that it's unbounded
//!
//! For queries which are unsafe to cache, the statement cache will never insert
//! them. They will be prepared and immediately released after use (or in the
//! case of PG they will use the unnamed prepared statement).
//!
//! For statements which are able to be cached, we then have to determine what
//! to use as the cache key. The standard method that virtually all ORMs or
//! database access layers use in the wild is to store the statements in a
//! hash map, using the SQL as the key.
//!
//! However, the majority of queries using Diesel that are safe to cache as
//! prepared statements will be uniquely identified by their type. For these
//! queries, we can bypass the query builder entirely. Since our AST is
//! generally optimized away by the compiler, for these queries the cost of
//! fetching a prepared statement from the cache is the cost of [`HashMap<u32,
//! _>::get`], where the key we're fetching by is a compile time constant. For
//! these types, the AST pass to gather the bind parameters will also be
//! optimized to accessing each parameter individually.
//!
//! Determining if a query can be cached by type is the responsibility of the
//! [`QueryId`] trait. This trait is quite similar to `Any`, but with a few
//! differences:
//!
//! - No `'static` bound
//!     - Something being a reference never changes the SQL that is generated,
//!       so `&T` has the same query id as `T`.
//! - `Option<TypeId>` instead of `TypeId`
//!     - We need to be able to constrain on this trait being implemented, but
//!       not all types will actually have a static query id. Hopefully once
//!       specialization is stable we can remove the `QueryId` bound and
//!       specialize on it instead (or provide a blanket impl for all `T`)
//! - Implementors give a more broad type than `Self`
//!     - This really only affects bind parameters. There are 6 different Rust
//!       types which can be used for a parameter of type `timestamp`. The same
//!       statement can be used regardless of the Rust type, so [`Bound<ST, T>`](crate::expression::bound::Bound)
//!       defines its [`QueryId`] as [`Bound<ST, ()>`](crate::expression::bound::Bound).
//!
//! A type returning `Some(id)` or `None` for its query ID is based on whether
//! the SQL it generates can change without the type changing. At the moment,
//! the only type which is safe to cache as a prepared statement but does not
//! have a static query ID is something which has been boxed.
//!
//! One potential optimization that we don't perform is storing the queries
//! which are cached by type ID in a separate map. Since a type ID is a u64,
//! this would allow us to use a specialized map which knows that there will
//! never be hashing collisions (also known as a perfect hashing function),
//! which would mean lookups are always constant time. However, this would save
//! nanoseconds on an operation that will take microseconds or even
//! milliseconds.
